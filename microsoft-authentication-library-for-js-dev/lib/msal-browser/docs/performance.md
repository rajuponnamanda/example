# Performance

Please refer to [msal-common/performance](../../msal-common/docs/performance.md) first, which outlines the techniques your application can use to improve the performance of token acquisition using MSAL. Read below for measuring performance in your apps.

## Measuring performance

Applications that want to measure the performance of authentication flows in MSAL.js can do so manually, or consume the performance measures taken by the library itself.

### addPerformanceCallback

Since version `@azure/msal-browser@2.23.0`, applications can register a callback to receive performance measurements taken by the library. These measurement will include end-to-end measurements for top-level APIs, as well as measurements for important internal APIs.

**Note for MSFT first-party applications**: We will be publishing an internal build of `@azure/msal-browser` that is already instrumented to capture this telemetry. Contact us for more details.

#### Example

```typescript
const msalInstance = new PublicClientApplication(config);

msalInstance.addPerformanceCallback((events: PerformanceEvent[]) => {
    events.forEach(event => {
        console.log(event);
    });
});
```

Example event:

```typescript
const event: PerformanceEvent = {
    correlationId: "03cad3ff-6682-4e3d-a0b4-d517b531c718",
	durationMs: 1873,
	endPageVisibility: "hidden",
	fromCache: false,
	name: "acquireTokenSilent",
	startPageVisibility: "visible",
	startTimeMs: 1636414041888,
	success: true,
    silentCacheClientAcquireTokenDurationMs: 0,
    silentRefreshClientAcquireTokenDurationMs: 150,
    silentIframeClientAcquireTokenDurationMs: 0
    cryptoOptsGetPublicKeyThumbprintDurationMs: 200,
    cryptoOptsSignJwtDurationMs: 8,
    clientId: "b50703d7-d12b-4ddc-8758-91053fe0aba4",
    authority: "https://login.microsoftonline.com/common",
    libraryName: "@azure/msal-browser-1p",
    libraryVersion: "2.22.2-beta.2",
    appName: "my-application",
    appVersion: "1.0.0"
}
```

The complete details for `PerformanceEvents` objects can be found [here](../../msal-common/src/telemetry/performance/PerformanceEvent.ts). Below is a list of some notable properties:

| **Property**                       | Type      | Description                                                            |
| ---------------------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`                             | `string`  | Name of the operation, usually matches the top-level API name (e.g. `acquireTokenSilent`, `acquireTokenByCode`, `ssoSilent`). |
| `durationMs`                       | `number`  | End-to-end duration in milliseconds for the operation.                 |
| `success`                          | `boolean` | Whether the operation was successful or not.                           |
| `fromCache`                        | `boolean` | Whether the operation retrieved the result from the cache.             |
| `correlationId`                    | `string`  | Correlation ID used for the operation (preferably unique per request). |
| `libraryVersion`                   | `string`  | Version of MSAL.js used for the operation.                             |
| `authority`                        | `string`  | Authority used for the operation.                                      |
| `<internalFunctionName>DurationMs` | `number`  | Duration in milliseconds for an internal operation.                    |

### removePerformanceCallback

The `addPerformanceCallback` API will return a callback id, which an application can pass to `PublicClientApplication.removePerformanceCallback` to unregister that callback from receiving performance events. It will return a boolean indicating whether or not the callback was successfully removed.

#### Example

```typescript
const msalInstance = new PublicClientApplication(config);

const callbackId: string = msalInstance.addPerformanceCallback((events: PerformanceEvent[]) => {
    events.forEach(event => {
        console.log(event);
    });
});

const removed: boolean = msalInstance.removePerformanceCallback(callbackId);
```
